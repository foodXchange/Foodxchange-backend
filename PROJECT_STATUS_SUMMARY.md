- **Process Management**: ts-node

### Current Implementation Features

#### Phase 1 Completed Features
1. **Sample Tracking System**
   - Comprehensive workflow stages (Request → Approval → Shipping → Testing → Negotiation → Compliance → Converted/Rejected)
   - Temperature monitoring for cold chain
   - AI insights for conversion probability and quality scoring
   - Compliance tracking

2. **Azure AI Integration**
   - Document Intelligence for automated document processing
   - Computer Vision for product image analysis
   - OpenAI for intelligent recommendations
   - Service Bus for async processing
   - Cognitive Search for advanced product search

3. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Redis integration for caching
   - MongoDB models and schemas
   - Express routing structure
   - Error handling middleware
   - Security middleware (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting)

### Current Issues to Fix

#### TypeScript Configuration Issues
1. **Module System**: Need to update tsconfig for ES modules support
2. **Type Errors**: 
   - Missing type definitions for route handlers
   - Implicit 'any' types throughout
   - Duplicate variable declarations
   - .tsx files being used for backend (should be .ts)

#### Code Quality Issues
1. File extensions should be .ts, not .tsx for backend
2. Missing proper TypeScript types
3. Unused imports and variables
4. Environment variable handling needs improvement

### Recommended Next Steps

#### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. Fix TypeScript configuration
2. Convert .tsx files to .ts
3. Add proper type definitions
4. Fix all build errors
5. Run linting and fix issues

#### Phase 2 Recommendations
1. **API Development**
   - Complete RESTful endpoints for all entities
   - Implement GraphQL layer for complex queries
   - Add API versioning

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Complete JWT implementation
   - Add role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Implement OAuth2 for third-party integrations

3. **Business Logic**
   - Order management system
   - RFQ (Request for Quote) processing
   - Supplier management
   - Compliance validation engine

4. **Data Pipeline**
   - Implement data import/export functionality
   - Add batch processing capabilities
   - Create ETL pipelines for analytics

5. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Complete Application Insights integration
   - Add custom metrics and alerts
   - Implement distributed tracing

6. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all services
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end testing setup

### Architecture Recommendations

1. **Microservices Consideration**
   - Current monolithic structure is fine for MVP
   - Plan for service decomposition as you scale
   - Consider containerization with Docker

2. **API Gateway**
   - Implement API gateway for rate limiting and authentication
   - Add request/response transformation

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Leverage Azure Service Bus for decoupling
   - Implement event sourcing for audit trails

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add API key management
   - Implement request signing
   - Add data encryption at rest

### Development Workflow Improvements

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Automated deployment to Azure
   - Environment-specific configurations

2. **Documentation**
   - API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
   - Architecture decision records (ADRs)
   - Development guidelines

3. **Performance**
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Database query optimization
   - CDN for static assets

### Business Value Opportunities

1. **AI-Powered Features**
   - Predictive analytics for demand forecasting
   - Automated compliance checking
   - Smart pricing recommendations
   - Quality prediction from images

2. **Integration Capabilities**
   - ERP system connectors
   - Payment gateway integration
   - Logistics provider APIs
   - Compliance database connections

3. **Analytics Dashboard**
