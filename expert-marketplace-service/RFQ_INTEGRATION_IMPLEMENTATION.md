# RFQ Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
The RFQ (Request for Quotation) Integration system has been successfully implemented for the FoodXchange Expert Marketplace. This integration enables seamless connection between the main FoodXchange platform and the expert marketplace, facilitating automated expert matching and bidding processes.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Webhook System
- **Secure webhook endpoints** for receiving RFQ events from the main platform
- **HMAC SHA256 signature validation** for webhook security
- **Batch processing support** for handling multiple events efficiently
- **Event types supported**:
  - RFQ lifecycle events (created, updated, published, cancelled, closed, awarded, expired)
  - Bid lifecycle events (submitted, updated, withdrawn, accepted, rejected)

### 2. Auto-Matching Engine
- **Intelligent matching algorithm** with 8-factor scoring system:
  - Category Match (30% weight)
  - Location Match (20% weight) - includes geographic distance calculations
  - Budget Match (15% weight)
  - Timeline Match (10% weight)
  - Skills Match (10% weight)
  - Experience Match (5% weight)
  - Rating Match (5% weight)
  - Availability Match (5% weight)
- **Minimum 60% match threshold** for automatic matching
- **Geographic distance calculations** using geolib library
- **Automatic expert notification** upon successful match

### 3. Bidding Platform
- **Complete bid lifecycle management**:
  - Create draft bids
  - Submit bids with validation
  - Update draft bids
  - Withdraw bids
- **Automated bid scoring** based on:
  - Budget competitiveness (25 points)
  - Timeline alignment (25 points)
  - Expert experience (25 points)
  - Proposal quality (25 points)
- **Bid validation** ensuring completeness before submission
- **Automatic analytics updates** for RFQ statistics

### 4. Analytics Service
- **RFQ-specific analytics**:
  - Bid statistics (total, submitted, draft, withdrawn)
  - Match statistics (total matches, conversion rates)
  - Timeline metrics (days active, time to first bid)
  - Engagement metrics (view counts, unique experts)
- **Overall platform analytics**:
  - Performance metrics across all RFQs
  - Trends analysis by day and category
  - Top performing categories and experts

## API Endpoints

### Webhook Endpoints (No Authentication)
- `POST /api/v1/rfq/webhooks/events` - Handle single RFQ events
- `POST /api/v1/rfq/webhooks/batch` - Handle batch RFQ events
- `POST /api/v1/rfq/webhooks/test` - Test webhook connectivity

### RFQ Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/rfq` - Get all RFQs (with filters)
- `GET /api/v1/rfq/active` - Get active RFQs for matching (experts only)
- `GET /api/v1/rfq/:rfqId` - Get RFQ details
- `GET /api/v1/rfq/:rfqId/matches` - Get matches for an RFQ
- `GET /api/v1/rfq/:rfqId/bids` - Get bids for an RFQ
- `GET /api/v1/rfq/:rfqId/analytics` - Get RFQ analytics
- `POST /api/v1/rfq/:rfqId/match-experts` - Manually trigger expert matching

### Expert-Specific Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/rfq/expert/matches` - Get RFQ matches for current expert
- `PUT /api/v1/rfq/expert/matches/:matchId/respond` - Respond to a match
- `GET /api/v1/rfq/expert/bids` - Get all bids for current expert

### Bid Management Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/rfq/:rfqId/bids` - Create a new bid
- `PUT /api/v1/rfq/bids/:bidId` - Update a bid
- `POST /api/v1/rfq/bids/:bidId/submit` - Submit a draft bid
- `POST /api/v1/rfq/bids/:bidId/withdraw` - Withdraw a bid
- `GET /api/v1/rfq/bids/:bidId` - Get bid details
- `POST /api/v1/rfq/bids/:bidId/accept` - Accept a bid (buyers only)
- `POST /api/v1/rfq/bids/:bidId/reject` - Reject a bid (buyers only)

### Analytics Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/rfq/analytics/overall` - Get overall RFQ analytics (admin only)

## Infrastructure Updates

### ARM Template Enhancements
- Added `WEBHOOK_SECRET` to Azure Key Vault for webhook signature validation
- Updated App Service settings with Key Vault references:
  - `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING`
  - `STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`
  - `WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  - `KEY_VAULT_URI`
- Maintained existing security configurations and auto-scaling policies

## Security Features
- **Webhook signature validation** using HMAC SHA256
- **Timestamp validation** to prevent replay attacks (5-minute window)
- **Role-based access control** for all endpoints
- **Expert isolation** - experts can only see their own bids
- **Key Vault integration** for secret management

## Next Steps
1. Configure webhook endpoints in the main FoodXchange platform
2. Set up monitoring and alerting for RFQ events
3. Implement real-time notifications for matched experts
4. Add comprehensive logging for audit trails
5. Performance optimization for high-volume RFQ processing

## Dependencies Added
- `geolib` - For geographic distance calculations in the matching algorithm

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test webhook signature validation with valid and invalid signatures
2. Verify matching algorithm accuracy with various expert profiles
3. Test bid submission flow end-to-end
4. Validate analytics data accuracy
5. Load test webhook endpoints for high-volume scenarios
