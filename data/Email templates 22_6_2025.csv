Major Israeli Distributor Seeking ice cream for privte lable Suppliers for Large-Scale Import,0,"Dear Mr./Mrs.,

My name is Rivka, and I'm searching for ice cream cones similar to Nestlé's ""pirulo"" ice cream. I work for the largest food wholesaler in Israel, and we are looking to import large volumes of this product. I hope to collaborate with your company regarding this item.

Please see the image below of the product we are looking for: 90*5 g (450 g) in a carton box.

Could we possibly collaborate on this type of product?
We are looking for private-label packaging and kosher-certified products. If you have kosher certification for the factory, that's great. If you don’t have it but are willing to obtain it, we are ready to assist and guide you through this process.
I hope we can move forward and begin collaborating with your company. Please share an update.

Thank you, Rivka.
Wishing you a joyful New Year!

Leading Israeli Distributor Seeking Premium Organic Tomato Products,0,"Dear [Potential Supplier],
I hope this email finds you well. My name is Ohad Strikowsky from Foodz Exchange (A.S.T Superfoods), and I'm reaching out to explore a potential partnership for organic tomato products. We've communicated in the past, including discussions with my father, Ze'ev, regarding organic sauces and canned products.
As Israel's largest organic distributor, we see a significant opportunity in the rapidly growing organic market, particularly for high-quality tomato products. We're looking to expand our product range with a reliable supplier who can meet our specific requirements:
Canned Tomatoes (cluster packaging of 2 cans):
Peeled tomatoes
Chopped tomatoes
Pasta Sauces (in 350 gr glass jars):
Basil
Bolognese base (no meat)
Garlic & Oregano
Arrabbiata



Key requirements include organic certification and kosher certification (we can assist with obtaining this if needed).
Our distribution network covers both specialty organic markets and organic sections in major supermarket chains, providing a broad reach for your products. The current market includes competitors like Barilla and La-Doria, but there's ample room for growth with the right products and partnership.
I believe that together, we could achieve significant success in the Israeli market. I'd love to discuss this opportunity further and learn more about your product range and capabilities.
Could we schedule a call next week to explore this potential partnership? I'm eager to hear your thoughts and discuss how we might work together.
